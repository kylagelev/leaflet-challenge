# leaflet-challenge

Earthquake Visualization using Leaflet. Includes 3 layers, including satellite, light, and dark, and a circle layer that indicates the earthquakes from the past 7 days. Updated continuously from [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). 

Circles indicate location of earthquake (specific latitude and longitude), color is indicative of depth, and radius is the magnitude of the earthquake multiplied by 7 (for better visualization). 

Attempt was made for Leaflet-Step-2, but not completed. Please reference Leaflet-Step-1 until further notice.

Visual of map is below.
